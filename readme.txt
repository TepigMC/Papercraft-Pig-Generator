//Pig Generator - Created By TepigMC

This generator creates a pig papercraft with options to include a saddle, helmet, and boots.
There are other options to enable the flat nose and full head that don't follow real minecraft, but are easier to make.
There is also a bonus matching ultra mini pig that was inspired by Maki.
