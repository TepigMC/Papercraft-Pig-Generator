#MINECRAFT PIG PAPERCRAFT GENERATOR
*Created by [TepigMC](http://pixelpapercraft.com/user/tepigmc)*

##Description
This generator creates a pig papercraft with an optional saddle, helmet, and boots that can be removable.
There are also options for a flat nose and simple head that don't follow real minecraft, but are easier to make.
There is also a bonus matching ultra mini pig that was inspired by [Maki](http://pixelpapercraft.com/user/maki).

##Sizing
The saddle, helmet, and boots can vary in texture size, so there may need to be some trimming to fit it over the pig.

The accessories page (second page) works the best if printed slightly larger than the pig page so it fits onto the pig better.
In Windows Photo Viewer, this can be solved by:
  - Unchecking 'Fit picture to frame' when you print the pig page
  - and Checking 'Fit picture to frame' for the accessories page.
